    Each game will last for 60 seconds.
    The player can either chose to be a painter or a guesser.
    As a painter, the player will get a word to draw.
    As soon as the painter has begun drawing, the guessers can start guessing.
    The guessers can also communicate with each other in the chat during the game.
