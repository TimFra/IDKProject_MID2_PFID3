    The game is place specific to Malmö Universitys building <i>"Niagara"</i>.<br>
    <br>
    The concept includes the use of second screens, where the game is displayed on a public screen
    while the players play the game on their smartphones.<br>
    <br>


 <b>How to play</b><br>

    <br>
     &#8226; Each game will last for 60 seconds.<br>
     <br>

   &#8226; The player can either choose to be a <i>painter</i> or a <i>guesser.</i> <br>
   <br>
   &#8226; As a painter, the player will get a word to draw.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; As soon as the painter has begun drawing, the guessers can start guessing.<br>
    <br>
    &#8226; The guessers can also communicate with each other in the chat during the game.
