    The game is place specific to Malm√∂ Universitys building "Niagara".\n \n

    The concept includes the use of second screens,
    where the game is displayed on a public screen
    while the players play the game on their smartphones.\n \n

    &#8226; Each game will last for 60 seconds.\n \n
    &#8226; The player can either chose to be a painter or a guesser.\n \n
    &#8226; As a painter, the player will get a word to draw.\n \n
    &#8226; As soon as the painter has begun drawing, the guessers can start guessing.\n \n
    &#8226; The guessers can also communicate with each other in the chat during the game.
